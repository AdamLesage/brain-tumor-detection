# Image Recognition Project

This project aims to develop an image recognition system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to detect and classify brain tumors from medical images.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.7 (or later) installed.
3. Install the dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
pip install keras h5py keras-resnet
python3 src/install.py
```

### Libraries explanation

- `keras` is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.
- `h5py` is a common package to interact with a dataset that is stored on an H5 file.
- `keras-resnet` is a library that provides pre-trained ResNet models.

1. Then enter your kaggle username and your kaggle key to download the dataset.
